# guidelinesApp
Application running the Guidelines of the Beta maṣāḥǝft project.
These guidelines are written in TEI/XML and the application is a simple eXist-db application using templating and an XSLT transformation for the views.
You can use these for your own guidelines given the same data structure and TEI encoding is used, and either install the package from .xar or clone this repository adding your data.
The schema is stored with the data of the Beta maṣāḥǝft Guidelines and can be found here https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/guidelines .
Also the ontology and schema directories are empty as the data is stored elsewhere in the organization.
